# ASSOCIATION_ML
This notebook demonstrates the concept and implementation of Association Rule Mining, a key technique in data mining for discovering relationships between variables in large datasets. The focus is on identifying frequent itemsets and generating association rules using algorithms such as Apriori and ECLAT. 


📄 Project Title:
Association Rule Mining using Apriori and ECLAT Algorithms

🎯 Objective:
Discover meaningful patterns in customer purchase behavior using Association Rule Mining to help businesses improve product placement, bundling strategies, and recommendation systems.

🔍 What is Association Rule Mining? 
Association Rule Mining is a data mining technique that uncovers relationships between items frequently purchased together. It enables businesses to identify shopping patterns and make data-driven decisions for better sales and marketing strategies.

🚀 Techniques:
Used Apriori Algorithm Identifies frequent itemsets by applying a bottom-up approach using minimum support thresholds.

ECLAT Algorithm An efficient technique that uses vertical data representation and TID-set intersections to generate frequent itemsets.

📚 Features:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Implementation of Apriori Algorithm using mlxtend
- Overview or simulation of ECLAT Algorithm
- Generation of frequent itemsets
- Extraction of strong association rules
- Visualization of rule metrics


📈 These insights can guide retailers in:

- Product bundling
- Cross-selling promotions
- Inventory planning
